# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets

This project contains a step by step description of several metods for analysing the sentiment of tweets into two classes and subsequent evaluation of the results. The code description and results are given as a Jupyter notebook

## Instructions
1. Although it is optional, we highly recommend the usage of virtual environments for this project. For basic setup and usage of virtual environments we recomend [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python - Virtual Environments blog post](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)

2. Install the python3 requirements using pip, and the contents of the `requirements.txt` file
```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the Jupyter Notebook server from the project root directory with 
```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```
This should open a new tab in the browser with the contents of the current directory. Open the `sentiment_analysis_of_tweets.ipynb` file to view the notebook for this project

4. Shutdown the server with Ctrl + C in the terminal session you used to start it
